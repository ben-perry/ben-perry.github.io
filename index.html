                    <p>I was a programmer on Two Point Hospital, a game that was made in the Unity game engine. Here are some of things I added to the game:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Custom lighting system that lights each room independently</li>
                        <li>Custom visual effects such as patient illnesses, fog of war and water reflections</li>
                        <li>Creating a modified version of Unity’s standard shader</li>
                        <li>Custom tools (custom sfx browser and more)</li>
                        <li>GUI</li>
                        <li>Procedural character generation</li>

                    <p class="annotation">Here is one of the tools I made, the “Two Point Hospital Viewer”. It was used by the sound effects team to add sound events to animations in the game. Was also used to test character generation, spawn characters along with hospital machines and play both their animations in sync./p>

                    <p>Made my own game using Unity. Uses a custom scriptable render pipeline made by myself. All code, art assets, shaders, and animations are all created by myself too.

                <div class="cellText">
                    <p>Before working on my game Adrift Arena, I prototyped an idea I had on how to achieve realtime global illumination. It combines the ideas of Forward+ and irradiance probes. The pixel shader gets GI information from a camera view frustum grid. Each cell in this 3D frustum grid is assigned what irradiance probes it overlaps with.</p>
